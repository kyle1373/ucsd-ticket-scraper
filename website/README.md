This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, create a `.env` based on `.env-example`  

Then, install node_modules by entering `npm i`  

Finally, run the server by entering `npm run dev`  

You should see the website running on `http://localhost:3000`
